# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection using Naive Bayes

This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and a **Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier** to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. It demonstrates a basic yet effective machine learning pipeline using `scikit-learn`.

## 📊 Dataset

- Loaded from `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`
- 569 samples and 30 features
- Target classes:
  - `0`: Malignant
  - `1`: Benign

## 📌 Features Used

- Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- Data visualization includes a pie chart of class distribution

## 🧠 Model

- Algorithm: **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
- Train-Test Split: 67% train / 33% test
- Accuracy achieved: ~**(you can paste your printed accuracy here)**

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-naive-bayes.git
   cd breast-cancer-naive-bayes
